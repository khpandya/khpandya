### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student passionate about connecting the theoretical and practical worlds of science.
I have had the great opportunity to build my own business and personal projects involving programming, superconductors as well as group projects such as Paradigm Hyperloop.

I never stop learning, I have self-developed coding, physics, mathematics and music skills using books and online resources and continue to develop new skills everyday.
I am looking for engineering co-op opportunities (4-month) starting September-2021 to keep learning from new experiences and move ahead with my passion for engineering.

I love giving back to the world all it has given me, I teach meditation and yoga for free and act as a peer counselor in my university for those who needs help with their mental health. I am also a chapter member of Engineers without Borders which serves and advocates humanitarian causes.

Apart from my incessant pursuit of knowledge-I enjoy swimming, writing poetry and classical music.

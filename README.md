### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineering student passionate about connecting the theoretical and practical worlds of science.
I have had the great opportunity to build my own business and learn from internships at innovative companies like Tesla.

I love giving back to the world all it has given me, I teach meditation and yoga for free and act as a peer counselor in my university for those who needs help with their mental health. I am also a chapter member of Engineers without Borders which serves and advocates humanitarian causes.

Apart from my incessant pursuit of knowledge-I enjoy swimming, writing poetry and classical music.
